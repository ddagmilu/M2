My general roadmap for my 5 years CS & Network & Security master graduate from University of Jijel, and how i tried to combine what i should study for each module and my free journey as cybersecurity junior

**Note** 
- Not all what in the list has been accomplished, and many of it was finished after the module exam
- Some certificates and topics were not included in this roadmap. You may plan to learn something and end up focusing on a related subject
